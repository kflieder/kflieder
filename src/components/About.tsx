        Hey! Iâ€™m Kacey, a full stack developer, artist, and all-around creative
        human currently based in Mexico. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by
        technology, but it wasnâ€™t until I moved to Mexico that I finally had the
        space, time, and energy to really dive into coding.
        <br /><br /> I started by
        building free websites for local businesses and friends, and quickly
        realized that creating digital experiences is where my passion truly
        comes alive. Now, I freelance full-time, helping others bring their
        ideas to life through clean design and functional web
        apps. 
        <br /> <br /> When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me sketching in
        charcoal, experimenting with pastel and paint, or jamming out on an
        instrument. I play saxophone and trombone (though itâ€™s been a while ðŸ˜…),
        and lately Iâ€™ve been learning to play drums â€” because apparently, rhythm
        follows me everywhere. Iâ€™m also a language nerd, both human and
        computer. Iâ€™m fairly fluent in Spanish (getting better every day), and I
        love how coding languages and spoken languages both shape the way we
        think and connect with others.
